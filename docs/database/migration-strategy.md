# Database Migration Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the strategy for managing database schema changes in the CreditCraft application using Prisma ORM migrations.

## Key Principles
- All schema changes must be made through Prisma migrations
- Migrations must be tracked in version control
- Schema changes must be tested thoroughly before deployment
- Rollback plans must be defined for each migration
- All migrations must be executed through CI/CD for production

## Migration Workflow

### Development Environment
1. Make changes to the Prisma schema file (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
2. Generate migration files with a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name descriptive_name
   ```
3. Review the generated SQL in the `prisma/migrations` directory
4. Test the migration and new schema
5. Commit the migration files to version control

### Production Deployment
1. Migrations are deployed through CI/CD using:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```
2. A backup is automatically taken before applying migrations
3. Migration success/failure is monitored and reported

## Rollback Strategy
1. For non-destructive changes (adding columns, tables), use a new migration to revert the change
2. For destructive changes (dropping columns, tables):
   - Create migration with data preservation steps
   - Store data in temporary tables for potential rollback
   - Establish a minimum downtime window

## Best Practices
1. **Small, Incremental Changes**: Break large schema changes into smaller, manageable migrations
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility where possible
3. **Testing**: Test migrations against a copy of production data
4. **Documentation**: Document each migration with its purpose and potential impact
5. **Schema Drift Detection**: Regularly compare production schema with expected schema

## Shadow Database Configuration
For migration testing, a shadow database is used:
- Automatic creation by Prisma during development
- Uses the same structure but with test data
- Enables testing migrations before applying to production

## Monitoring and Metrics
- Database size and growth tracking
- Migration duration metrics
- Table access patterns and query performance
- Index usage statistics

## Emergency Procedures
1. **Migration Failure**: 
   - Restore from the pre-migration backup
   - Analyze failure cause
   - Fix issues and retry with improved migration
2. **Performance Degradation**:
   - Monitor query performance post-migration
   - Have hotfix migrations ready for index adjustments

## Team Responsibilities
- Developers: Create and test migrations
- DevOps: Configure and monitor migration deployments
- DBA/Lead: Review complex migrations and approve production changes
